/**
 * <p>Class used to control the evolution of the game.</p>
 * <p>It holds and manages all the information about a single game:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>board;</li>
 *     <li>bookshelves;</li>
 *     <li>players (and their points);</li>
 *     <li>chat logs;</li>
 *     <li>etc.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>The model's public methods allow the players to modify the state of game by:
 *      <ul>
 *          <li>removing tiles from the board;</li>
 *          <li>changing the order of the selected tiles;</li>
 *          <li>adding the tiles to their bookshelves.</li>
 *      </ul>
 *
 *     <p>
 *         The model also manages the turns. When a player adds a tile to his bookshelf
 *         the game advances to the next turn since it is the last move a player can do during
 *         his turn.
 *     </p>
 *     <p>
 *         The model selects the next non-disconnected player in line; if there is only one player left
 *         it selects the first disconnected player it finds to stop the game and wait for at least another
 *         player to reconnect or it will end the game after 2 minutes.
 *     </p>
 *     <p>
 *         The model also notifies the virtual views of each player with the necessary information for the
 *         client such as the points, the state of the board, the bookshelves, and the current player.
 *     </p>
